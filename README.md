## A simple OpenGL renderer
Not much to say currently, but I'll add more later.

### Compilation (Linux)
    git clone https://github.com/Jan-Stangelj/Renderer.git
    cd Renderer
    mkdir build
    ./build.sh

### Compilation (Non linux)
You should be able to clone this project and use cmake GUI to compile it
for your platform of choice (eg. Visual Studio).
